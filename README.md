=========

Classical trajectory Monte-Carlo simulator program for atomic orbitals written in C++.

A renaissance in classical methods, particularly methods based on trajectory calculation started over the 60's in atomic physics. Bohrbiter was created for the sake of entering this area and carrying out quasi-classical calculations. Bohrbiter is a Monte-Carlo simulator program that can host classical and quasi-classical atomic models. The program written in C++ is flexible so that it can be easily extended in order to use an arbitrary quasi-classical atomic model or an arbitrary number of particles. The software has a high-level abstraction in the domain of atomic physics, the computer model represents atoms, nuclei, electrons, orbitals. Two specific atomic models are worked out, the classical Abrines-Percival model and the quasi-classical Kirschbaum-Wilets model.

Simulbody and Boost version >= 1.54 including Boost.Build (bjam) is required for build.
